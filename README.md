# awslim

awslim is a CLI for AWS services by [Go](https://go.dev/).

This CLI is generated from the [AWS SDK Go v2](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2) service client.

## Motivation

The [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) is very useful, but it requires too many CPU resources to boot up. This cli is a simplified and fast alternative to the AWS CLI for limited use cases.

This CLI is a simple wrapper of the AWS SDK Go v2, and it is not a full-featured CLI like the AWS CLI.

This CLI can,
- Call any method(API) of the AWS service client.
- Use JSON or Jsonnet for input.
- Output the result in JSON format.
- Bind a file to the input/output struct of the method.
- Query the output by JMESPath.
- Use the AWS CLI configuration file. (for example, `~/.aws/config`)

This CLI cannot,
- 100% compatible with the AWS CLI.
- Use the AWS CLI plugins. (for example, `session-manager-plugin`)

## Install

**Note:** The release binaries are large (about 500MB after being extracted) and slow a bit to boot up (about 100ms), because they contain codes for access to **[all AWS services](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service)**.

Itâ€™s best to build your optimized binary if you don't need to access all AWS services(a most use case). You can build the binary yourself easily. See [Build](#build) section.

### Release binary

Download the binary from the [release page](https://github.com/fujiwara/awslim/releases).

### Homebrew

```console
$ brew install fujiwara/tap/awslim
```

## Build

You can build the client yourself, including only the needed services and methods. The optimized binary is small and boots up quickly.

The client is built by a configuration file `gen.yaml` or `AWSLIM_GEN` environment variable.

### `AWSLIM_GEN` environment variable

Set the environment variable `AWSLIM_GEN` to list the services joined by commas.

For example, to build the client for ECS, Firehose, and S3:

```console
$ export AWSLIM_GEN="ecs,firehose,s3"
```

All methods of the specified services are generated. To build only specified methods, use the `gen.yaml` configuration file.

### `gen.yaml` configuration file

```yaml
# gen.yaml
services:
  ecs:
    - DescribeClusters
    - DescribeTasks
  firehose:
    - DescribeDeliveryStream
    - ListDeliveryStreams
  s3:
    # all methods of the service
```

Keys of `services` are AWS service names (`github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/*`), and values are method names of the service client (for example, `s3` is [s3.Client](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3#Client)). If you don't specify the method names, all methods of the service client are generated.

### Build on your machine

To build the client, run the following commands (or simply run `make`):

```console
$ go generate ./cmd/awslim-gen .
$ go build -o your-client ./cmd/awslim/main.go
```

1. `go generate ./cmd/awslim-gen .` generates the generator by `gen.yaml`.
2. `go build -o your-client ./cmd/awslim/main.go` builds your client.

If you change the configuration, run `make clean` before `make` to purge the generated files.

### Build with Docker

`ghcr.io/fujiwara/awslim:builder` is a Docker image that contains the Go environment. You can build the client in the container.

Environment variables:
- `GIT_REF`: Git reference to checkout the repository. Default is `main`. You can specify a branch, tag, or commit hash.

Example of use `AWSLIM_GEN` environment variable:
```console
$ docker run -it -e AWSLIM_GEN=ecs,firehose,s3 ghcr.io/fujiwara/awslim:builder
...
```

Example of `gen.yaml` configuration file:
```console
$ docker run -it -v $(pwd)/gen.yaml:/app/gen.yaml ghcr.io/fujiwara/awslim:builder
...
Completed. Please extract /app/awslim from this container!
For example, run the following command:
docker cp $(docker ps -lq):/app/awslim .
```

After the build is completed, the built binary is in the container. You can copy it to your host machine with `docker cp` command.

```console
$ docker cp $(docker ps -lq):/app/awslim .
```

### Docker Multi-stage build

`ghcr.io/fujiwara/awslim:builder` can use as a builder image in a multi-stage build.

Run `./build-in-docker.sh` in the container to build the client. The built binary is in the `/app` directory. You can copy it to the final image.

```Dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/fujiwara/awslim:builder AS builder
ENV AWSLIM_GEN=ecs,firehose,s3
ENV GIT_REF=v0.0.13
RUN ./build-in-docker.sh

FROM debian:bookworm-slim
COPY --from=builder /app/awslim /usr/local/bin/awslim
```

## Performance comparison

Example of execution `sts get-caller-identity` on 0.25vCPU Fargate(AMD64).
`/usr/bin/time -v` is used for measurement.

| command | CPU time(user, sys)| Elapsed time(s) | Max memory(MB) |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | --- |
| aws               | 0.67 + 0.10 = 0.77 | 3.11 | 64.2 |
| awslim(all) | 0.08 + 0.03 = 0.11 | 0.43 | 101.5 |
| awslim(40) | 0.02 + 0.01 = 0.03 | 0.05 | 30.2 |

- `awslim`(built for all AWS services): 7.0x faster than `aws`
- `awslim`(built for 40 AWS services): 62.0x faster than `aws`

`aws-cli/2.15.51 Python/3.11.8`, `awslim 0.0.10`

- `service`: AWS service name.
- `method`: Method name of the service client.
- `input`: JSON input for the method.

The output is JSON format.

### Example usage

#### Show supported services

```console
$ awslim
```

#### Show methods of the service

```console
$ awslim ecs
```

#### Call method of the service

The third argument is [JSON](https://json.org) or [Jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org/) input for the method. If the method does not require input, you can omit the third argument (implicitly `{}` passed).

```console
$ awslim ecs DescribeClusters '{"Cluster":"default"}' # JSON
```

```console
$ awslim ecs DescribeClusters "{Cluster:'default'}"   # Jsonnet
```

If the method name is "kebab-case", it automatically converts to "PascalCase" (for example, `describe-clusters` -> `DescribeClusters`).

```console
$ awslim ecs describe-clusters '{"Cluster":"default"}'
```

The third argument can be a filename that contains JSON or Jsonnet input.

```console
$ awslim ecs DescribeClusters my.jsonnet
```

**Note**: By default, the input JSON is unmarshaled strictly. Unknown fields for the input struct in the input JSON cause an error. If you want to unmarshal the input JSON non-strictly, use `--no-strict` option.

#### `--ext-str` and `--ext-code` options

`--ext-str` and `--ext-code` options allow you to pass external variables to Jsonnet.

This is useful when you want to use variables in Jsonnet.

```console
$ awslim ecs DescribeClusters my.jsonnet --ext-str Cluster=default
```

```jsonnet
// my.jsonnet
{
  Cluster: std.extVar("Cluster"),
}
```

#### `--input-stream` option

`--input-stream` (`-i`) option allows you to bind a file or stdin to the input struct.

```console
$ awslim s3 put-object '{"Bucket": "my-bucket", "Key": "my.txt"}' --input-stream my.txt
```

[s3#PutObjectInput](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3#PutObjectInput) has `Body` field of `io.Reader`. `--input-stream` option binds the file to the field.

When the input struct has only one field of `io.Reader`, `awslim` reads the file and binds it to the field automatically. (Currently, all SDK input structs have at most one io.Reader field.)

When the input struct has a "\*Length" field for the size of the content, `awslim` sets the size of the content to the field automatically. For example, [s3#PutObjectInput](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3#PutObjectInput) has `ContentLength` field.

If `--input-stream` is "-", `awslim` reads from stdin. In this case, `awslim` reads all contents into memory, so it is not suitable for large files. Consider using a file for large content.

#### `--output-stream` option

`--output-stream` (`-o`) option allows you to bind the `io.ReadCloser` of the API output to a file or stdout.

```console
$ awslim s3 get-object '{"Bucket": "my-bucket", "Key": "my.txt"}' --output-stream my.txt
```

[s3#GetObjectOutput](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3#PutObjectOutput) has `Body` field of `io.ReadeCloser`. `--output-stream` option binds the file to the field.

When the output struct has only one field of `io.ReadCloser`, `awslim` copies it to the file automatically. (Currently, all SDK output structs have at most one io.ReadCloser field.)

If `--output-stream` is "-", `awslim` writes into stdout. The result of the API also writes to stdout by default. If you don't want to output the result, use `--no-api-output`.

#### `--raw-output` option

`--raw-output` (`-r`) option allows you to output raw strings, not JSON texts.

This option is like `jq -r`.

#### `--follow-next` option

`--follow-next` (`-f`) option set the output/input field name of the next token. This option is useful for paginated APIs.

For example, [s3#ListObjectsV2Output](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3#ListObjectsV2Output) has `NextContinuationToken` field, and [s3#ListObjectsV2Input](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3#ListObjectsV2Input) has `ContinuationToken` field. You can follow the next token by the following command.

`{FieldInOutput}={FieldInInput}` format is used for `--follow-next` option.

```console
$ awslim s3 list-objects-v2 '{"Bucket": "my-bucket"}' \
  --follow-next NextContinuationToken=ContinuationToken
```

If the same field name is used in the output and input, you can omit the input field name.

```console
$ awslim ecs list-tasks '{"Cluster":"default"}' \
  --follow-next NextToken
```

#### Query output by JMESPath

`--query` option allows you to query the output by JMESPath like the AWS CLI.

```console
$ awslim ecs DescribeClusters '{"Cluster":"default"}' \
  --query 'Clusters[0].ClusterArn'
```

#### Show help

awslim is a simple wrapper of the AWS SDK Go v2 service client. Its usage is the same as that of the AWS SDK Go v2. If the third argument is "help", it shows the URL of the method documentation.

```console
$ awslim ecs DescribeClusters help
See https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/ecs#Client.DescribeClusters
```
